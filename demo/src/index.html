  	<p>Regular expression is often used to validate input in a form. Typically it checks the input field as the form is about to be submitted, or when the used moves the input focus out of the field being validated. But it would be nice if the input could be validated as the user types intp the field. This is not possible since regular expression needs the entire input to be compleded before it can do the validation.
